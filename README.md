# Optical-Flow based motion tracking

Optical Flow-Based Motion Tracking:

This project leverages optical flow techniques to track and analyze the motion of people in a video. By processing video input, the system identifies and visualizes the motion paths of individuals in real-time, offering an effective solution for monitoring human movements in various scenarios, such as security, crowd analysis, or activity tracking.

# Features:

Real-Time Motion Tracking: Uses optical flow to detect and track motion in video footage.
Visual Path Representation: Displays the trajectories of detected movements for better visualization.
Versatile Input: Processes video files or live feeds from a camera.
Customizable Parameters: Adjust optical flow sensitivity and visualization preferences.

# How It Works:

Video Input: The system accepts a video file or live camera feed as input.

Motion Detection: Applies optical flow algorithms (e.g., Lucas-Kanade or Farneback methods) to identify movement in the video.

Trajectory Visualization: Tracks and overlays motion paths on the video frames for analysis.

Output: Displays the processed video with motion paths in real-time or saves it for later review.

# Technologies Used:

Programming Language: Python

Computer Vision Library: OpenCV

Algorithms: Optical flow techniques (e.g., Farneback, Lucas-Kanade)

Hardware: Supports video from webcams or pre-recorded files.

# Applications:

Security: Monitor and analyze movement in surveillance footage.

Sports Analysis: Track player movements for performance insights.

Crowd Management: Observe crowd flow and behavior.

Research: Study human motion patterns.

# Future Improvements:

1-Integration with deep learning for enhanced motion detection and classification.

2-Multi-person tracking with unique IDs for each individual.

3-Exporting motion data for statistical analysis.
